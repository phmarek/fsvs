- Removed nested functions, to make the stack non-executable
  (gcc needs trampoline code).
  See http://fsvs.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=17.

Changes in 1.2.4
- Bugfix: auto-props not applied for explicitly specified entries.
  Thanks to Peter for the detailed bug report!
  Please note that the auto-props _only_ get applied if there are
  _no_ properties on an entry set (yet); so, after
    fsvs prop-set file property...
  the auto-props will _not_ be applied (as they might overwrite
  the manually set properties).

Changes in 1.2.3
- Compilation fixes for MacOS 10.6; thanks, Thomas!
- Added "password" option, as sent by Mark. Thank you!
- Workarounds for gcc-4.5 and gcc-4.6 regressions. Thank you, Brian!
- Compatibility with autoconf 2.68.

Changes in 1.2.2
- Tried to get configuration/compilation to work with OSX 10.6.
  Thanks, Florian.
- Fix for a stray "fstat64", which compilation for MacOSX10.4.
  Thank you, Mike.
- Fix length calculation bug, found by Mark via a (bad?) compilation warning.
  Thank you!

Changes in 1.2.1
- Documentation fixes. Thank you, Gunnar.
- Fixed config_dir, so that using other authentication paths work.
  Previously $CONF/auth was fixed; better default.
- Fix "unversion" on the wc root.
- Fix "." as only parameter when started from the root.
- Two compile fixes; thank you, Stan!
- Solaris 10 compatibility fixes. Thank you, Stan!
- Fix SIGPIPE handling.
- Don't do the "_base" symlink; it breaks eg. "grep -r /etc". Write an
  readme instead.

- New option "dir_exclude_mtime". Thank you, Gunnar!

- Fixed some small bugs
- The secondary URL/revision file doesn't have to exist. Thank you, Mark!
- Fix recursive behaviour of "_build-new-list".
- Now supports arbitrary "svn+" tunnels, like subversion does.
  Thank you, Jake.
- "fsvs log -v" for now filters the changed entries list, and shows the 
  paths relative to the parameter.
- Fixed "-o verbose=all" output; would be interpreted as "totally silent" 
  because of signed compares.
- Better out-of-date messages.
- Make 'ext-tests' work with debian /bin/sh => dash, too.
- Compatibility fixes for subversion 1.6.4.
- Fix tempfile being left after FSVS run.
