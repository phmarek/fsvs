What does it do?
----------------

FSVS is a backup/archival/versioning tool, which uses subversion backends 
for storage. This means that previous versions of all files are available 
in case of hardware problems, data loss, virus infections, user problems etc.

FSVS is used to take snapshots of the current machine and restore them;
all advanced operations (taking diffs, merging, etc.) should be done via
some repository browser.

FSVS runs currently on Linux, OpenBSD and OS X, and I think it works with
Solaris, too - in short, UNIX should be fine.


Why was it written?
-------------------

Well, mostly to scratch an itch :-)
Backup methods using rsync have no or very limited history, 
svn saves no metadata and needs double local storage, svk doesn't understand
all file types and is (IMO) too slow for full system versioning.


How is it used?
---------------

Please take a look at subversion [1]'s documentation; subversion's libraries
(and by implication apr [2]) are needed for operation. See also the 
subversion book [3].

First install subversion (and, by implication, apr). 
Next compile fsvs.
    ./configure
    cd src
    make
And install the binary: (the man-pages are not automatically installed yet.)
    make install
Make a repository somewhere, preferably on another machine.
    svnadmin create /path/to/repos
Create a local directory for the "working copy administrative area". If you'd
like to use another path, just set the environment variable WAA to it.
    mkdir -p /var/spool/fsvs /etc/fsvs
Go to the base path for versioning:
    cd /
Tell fsvs which URL it should use:
    fsvs url svn+ssh://username@machine/path/to/repos
Define ignore patterns - all virtual filesystems (/proc, /sys, etc.), and 
(assuming that you're in / currently) the temporary files in /tmp:
    fsvs ignore DEVICE:0 ./tmp/*
And you're ready to play!
Check your data in:
    fsvs commit -m "First import"


See the files in doc for more details; here, as (ordered) list:
	fsvs.1               - Manual page; describes FSVS' commands
	USAGE                - Manual page in ASCII
	IGNORING             - Why/how to ignore entries
	fsvs-url-format.5    - Detailed description of FSVS' URLs definitions
	fsvs-options.5       - Options for FSVS (command line, config file)
	fsvs-howto-backup.5  - A short HOWTO.

These documents can be browsed in HTML on http://doc.fsvs-software.org/, 
too. (And they're a bit more readable there.)

If it bails out with an error, I'd appreciate if you'd run the failing command
with the option "-v" (verbose) and send the last lines to the developers
mailing list; sometimes it may be necessary to see the complete debug log 
file, which you can get by using "-v -d".
